### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Lenore! I'm a front end web developer. I wake up, drink my Mountain Dew, Code and become inspired by many different things!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building a few versions of my portfolio! Why? well what if the antique white isn't every ones jam? Maybe another color comes off as more professional. 
- 
- ðŸŒ± I'm deciding on how to build my passion project.
- 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m inlove with react (dont tell Javascript I like the better version!)
- 
- ðŸ“« Reaching out to me is as simple as sending an email to my outlook. lenore.laufeyson13@outlook.com

- âš¡ Fun fact: I've been developing my coding skills for the last 5 years which means I have more than likely deleted my old git hub because it was too crowded.

Keep an eye on my repository because you never know what might pop up.
