Hello!

My name is Lenore! I'm a front end web developer. I wake up, drink my Boba Tea, Code and become inspired by many different things!

🏻-👩🏻‍💻I'm currently learning new things. I have decided on doing mini projects while I figure out how to build using fullstack. 
- 
-🖥 I'm currently considering a few passion projects.Back when Myspace was the hottest thing I wanted to learn to make my own social networking platform. That became my first passion project. My more recent passion project is building my own website, with a blog that does a similar format as Blogger or wordpress. As that format to write an entry is much eaiser.But as of recent I kind of want to design my own Website and come up with a throw back version of Bebo because it was less complex than Myspace but still pretty great.
- 
-💋 I’m inlove with react (dont tell Javascript I like the better version!)
- 
- 📫 Reaching out to me is as simple as sending an email to my gmail. lenore.laufeyson13@gmail.com

-🧋Fun fact: I've been developing my coding skills for the last 5 years which means I have more than likely deleted my old git hub because it was too crowded.

Keep an eye on my repository because you never know what might pop up.
